# Generative Models

Exploring different architectures and techniques for generating new content.

## Overview

Generative models learn to create new data that resembles the training data. Unlike discriminative models that learn boundaries between classes, generative models learn the underlying distribution of the data.

## Types of Generative Models

### 1. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Generator vs Discriminator
- Applications in image generation

### 2. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Encoder-Decoder architecture
- Latent space representation

### 3. Diffusion Models
- Forward and reverse diffusion process
- Stable Diffusion, DALL-E

### 4. Autoregressive Models
- Sequential generation
- Transformers for text generation

## Coming Soon

- GAN implementations
- VAE from scratch
- Diffusion model exploration
